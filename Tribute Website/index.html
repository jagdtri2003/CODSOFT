                Chandra Shekhar Tiwari, popularly known as Chandrashekhar Azad, was an Indian Revolutionary leader and a Freedom fighter. After the deaths of the founder of Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), Ram Prasad Bismil, and three other prominent party leaders, Roshan Singh, Rajendra Nath Lahiri, and Ashfaqulla Khan, he reorganized the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) under the new name of Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA). When signing pamphlets as the commander in chief of the HSRA, he often used the alias "Balraj".
